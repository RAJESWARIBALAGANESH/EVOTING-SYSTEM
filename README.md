# EVOTING-SYSTEM
The E-Voting System is a secure, GUI-based desktop application designed to facilitate electronic voting using Python (Tkinter) for the user interface and PostgreSQL as the backend database. This system ensures a transparent and tamper-proof voting process by implementing user authentication, candidate management, and real-time vote counting.
